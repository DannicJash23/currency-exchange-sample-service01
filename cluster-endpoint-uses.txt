Cluster Endpoint (Writer Endpoint)
Write Operations: The cluster endpoint directs all write operations to the primary instance in the Aurora cluster. This primary instance is the only one that can handle write operations.

Read Operations: The cluster endpoint can also handle read operations. However, to optimize performance, read operations are usually distributed among multiple reader instances in the cluster.

Benefits of Using Cluster Endpoint for Read/Write
Automatic Failover: If the primary instance fails, Aurora automatically promotes one of the read replicas to be the new primary. The cluster endpoint dynamically points to the new primary instance, ensuring high availability.

Simplified Connection Management: Using the cluster endpoint for both read and write operations simplifies connection management since your application only needs to be aware of one endpoint.

Consistency and Integrity: All write operations go to the primary instance, ensuring data consistency and integrity across the cluster.

Using the Aurora cluster endpoint simplifies the process of managing read and write operations, while ensuring high availability and automatic failover, which is critical for mission-critical applications.
